A DEX for shillers and Meme coins.

## Functionality

### Memez Swap

The Memez Swap allows users to deploy Meme Pools and earn trading fees. The pools only support swapping. They do not expose liquidity management functions. This means that it is impossible to rug as there is no LpCoin. The liquidity is always locked forever at deployment.

The DEX uses the famous `k = x * y` popularized by [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf).

It supports the following operations:

- Create Pool to get the fun going.
- Swap to retire or jeet.
- Referrals to pump together.
- Flash loans for extra bling bling!
- Dynamic Fees for max profitability.

Thats it!!

### Deployer

The deployer is the user who creates the pool. He receives a `DeployerNFT` that earns trading fees for life. Meme coin devs can earn revenue to fund their marketing activities for life.

### Referrals

The more apes the better. Memez has a native referral system. Degens can refer other degens to earn extra money. We are ALL gonna make it.

### Fees

Swap fees play a crucial role in Memez Swap. Fees are configurable per pool by the protocol admin. The pool applies a dynamic to trades based on the on-chain volume. This allows to maximize profitability and trading. Periods of high volume incur higher trading fees while low volume periods do not.

#### Liquidity Fee

The pool takes a liquidity fee to ensure that base liquidity increases over time. This is to ensure pumps and dumps do not hitler the chart.

#### Sell/Burn Fee

The pool can burn a % of a coin in every swap to increase its market cap. This fee is only applied when the jeet is selling the coin. We send the coin to the 0x0 address instead of shrinking the coin supply for pumpnomics.

#### Admin Fee

The protocol takes a small percentage in each swap to fund development to deploy more degen dApps.

#### Deployer Fee

The deployer of the pool earns trading fees eternally. Since he is the only liquidity provider, this can fund the `dev` to keep cooking and buy pay KOLs and shillers.
